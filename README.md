🚀 Introduction
=================

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines on how to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

> Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems

Wikipedia describes them as

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

⚠️ Be Careful
-----------------
- Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
- Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so. Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solutions **finding** problems; so don't overthink.
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

Types of Design Patterns

* [Creational](#creational-design-patterns)
* [Structural](#structural-design-patterns)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral-design-patterns)

Creational Design Patterns
==========================

In plain words
> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

 * [Factory Method](#-factory-method)
 * [Abstract Factory](#-abstract-factory)
 * [Builder](#-builder)
 * [Prototype](#-prototype)
 * [Singleton](#-singleton)

🏠 Simple Factory
--------------
Real world example
> Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. It would be a mess if every time you need a door, you put on your carpenter clothes and start making a door in your house. Instead you get it made from a factory.

In plain words
> Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be "new".

**Programmatic Example**

First of all we have a door interface and the implementation

```C++
class Door
{
public:
    virtual float getWidth() = 0;
    virtual float getHeight() = 0;
};
class WoodenDoor: public Door
{
private:
	float width;
	float height;
public:
	WoodenDoor(float width, float height)
    	:width(width),height(height)
    {
    }
	virtual float getWidth()
    {
    	return width;
    }
    virtual float getHeight()
    {
    	return height;
    }
};
```

Then we have our door factory that makes the door and returns it

```c++
class DoorFactory
{
public:
    static Door* makeDoor(float width, float height)
    {
        return new WoodenDoor(width, height);
    }
};
```

And then it can be used as

```c++
Door* door = DoorFactory::makeDoor(100,200);
std::cout<< door->getWidth() << std::endl;
std::cout<< door->getHeight() << std::endl;
```


**When to Use?**

When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.

🏭 Factory Method
--------------

Real world example
> Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.

In plain words
> It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

Wikipedia says
> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

 **Programmatic Example**

Taking our hiring manager example above. First of all we have an interviewer interface and some implementations for it

```c++
class Interviewer
{
public:
    virtual void askQuetions() = 0;
};

class Developer: public Interviewer
{
public:
	virtual void askQuestions()
    {
    	std::cout<<"Asking about design patterns!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class CommunityExecutive: public Interviewer
{
public:
	virtual void askQuestions()
    {
    	std::cout << "Asking about community building" << std::endl;
    }
};
```



Now let us create our `HiringManager`

```c++
class HiringManager
{
public:
    virtual Interviewer* makeInterviewer() = 0;
    void takeInterview()
    {
        Interviewer* interviewer = makeInterviewer();
        interviewer->askQuestions();
    }
};
```



Now any child can extend it and provide the required interviewer

```c++
class DevelopmentManager: public HiringManager
{
public:
	virtual Interviewer* makeInterviewer()
    {
    	return new Developer();
    }
};

class MarketingManager: public HiringManager
{
public:
	virtual Interviewer* makeInterviewer()
    {
    	return new CommunityExecutive();
    }
};
```

and then it can be used as

```c++
HiringManager* devManager = new DevelopmentManager();
devManager->takeInterview();

HiringManager* marketingManager = new MarketingManager();
marketingManager->takeInterview();
```

or it can be used by a function like the following

```c++
int getManager(std::string s, HiringManager** pHiringManager)
{
    if(s=="dev")
    {
        *pHiringManager = new DevelopmentManager();
        return 0;
    }
    else if(s=="marketing")
    {
        *pHIringManager = new MarketingManager();
        return 0;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**When to use?**

Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime. Or putting it in other words, when the client doesn't know what exact sub-class it might need.

🔨 Abstract Factory
----------------

Real world example
> Extending our door example from Simple Factory. Based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop, iron door from an iron shop or a PVC door from the relevant shop. Plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door, for example a carpenter for wooden door, welder for iron door etc. As you can see there is a dependency between the doors now, wooden door needs carpenter, iron door needs a welder etc.

In plain words
> A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.

Wikipedia says
> The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

**Programmatic Example**

Translating the door example above. First of all we have our `Door` interface and some implementation for it

```c++
class Door
{
public:
    virtual void getDescription() = 0;
};

class WoodenDoor: public Door
{
public: 
	virtual void getDescription()
    {
    	std::cout << "I am a wooden door" << std::endl;
    }
};

class IronDoor: public Door
{
public:
	virtual void getDescription()
    {
    	std::cout << "I am a iron door" << std::endl;
    }
};
```


Then we have some fitting experts for each door type

```c++
class DoorFittingExpert
{
public:
	virtual void getDescription() = 0;
};

class Welder: public DoorFittingExpert
{
public:
	virtual void getDescription()
    {
    	std::cout<< "I can only fit iron doors" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Carpenter: public DoorFittingExpert
{
public:
	virtual void getDescription()
    {
    	std::cout << "I can only fit wooden doors" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

Now we have our abstract factory that would let us make family of related objects i.e. wooden door factory would create a wooden door and wooden door fitting expert and iron door factory would create an iron door and iron door fitting expert

```c++
class DoorFactory
{
public:
    virtual Door* makeDoor() = 0;
 	virtual DoorFittingExpert* makeFittingExpert() = 0;
};

class WoodenDoorFactory: DoorFactory
{
public:
	Door* makeDoor()
    {
    	return new WoodenDoor();
    }
    DoorFittingExpert* makeFittingExpert()
    {
    	return new Carpenter();
    }
};

class IronDoorFactory: DoorFactory
{
public:
	Door* makeDoor()
    {
    	return new IronDoor();
    }
    DoorFittingExpert* makeFittingExpert()
    {
    	return new Welder();
    }
};
```

And then it can be used as

```c++
DoorFactory* woodenFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory();

Door* door;
DoorFittingExpert* expert;
door = woodenFactory->makeDoor();  
expert = woodenFactory->makeFittingExpert();
door->getDescription(); // Output: I am a wooden door
expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit wooden doors

DoorFactory* ironFactory = new IronDoorFactory();
door = ironFactory->makeDoor();
expert = ironFactory->makeFittingExpert();
door->getDescription(); // Output: I am an iron door
expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit iron doors

```



As you can see the wooden door factory has encapsulated the `carpenter` and the `wooden door` also iron door factory has encapsulated the `iron door` and `welder`. And thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door, we do not get a wrong fitting expert.   

**When to use?**

When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved

👷 Builder
--------------------------------------------
Real world example
> Imagine you are at Hardee's and you order a specific deal, lets say, "Big Hardee" and they hand it over to you without *any questions*; this is the example of simple factory. But there are cases when the creation logic might involve more steps. For example you want a customized Subway deal, you have several options in how your burger is made e.g what bread do you want? what types of sauces would you like? What cheese would you want? etc. In such cases builder pattern comes to the rescue.

In plain words
> Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.

Wikipedia says
> The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

Having said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti-pattern is. At one point or the other we have all seen a constructor like below

```c++
someClass::constructor(size_t size, bool cheese = true, bool pepperoni = true, bool tomato = false, bool lettuce = true)
{
    
}
```

As you can see; the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of hand and it might become difficult to understand the arrangement of parameters. Plus this parameter list could keep on growing if you would want to add more options in future. This is called telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

**Programmatic Example**

The sane alternative is to use the builder pattern. First of all we have our burger that we want to make

```c++
class Burger
{
private:
    size_t size;
    bool cheese = false;
    bool pepperoni = false;
    bool lettuce = false;
    bool tomato = false;
    
public:
    Burger(const BurgerBuilder& builder)
    {
        this->size = builder.size;
        this->cheese = builder.cheese;
        this->pepperoni = builder.pepperoni;
        this->lettuce = builder.lettuce;
        this->tomato = builder.tomato.
    }
}
```



And then we have the builder

```c++
class BurgerBuilder
{
private:
    size_t size;
    bool cheese = false;
    bool pepperoni = false;
    bool lettuce = false;
    bool tomato = false;
public:
    BurgerBuilder(size_t size)
        :size(size)
    {
            
    }
    BurgerBuilder& addPepperoni()
    {
        this->pepperoni = true;
        return *this;
    }
    BurgerBuilder& addLettuce()
    {
        this->lettuce = true;
        return *this;
    }
        
    BurgerBuilder& addCheese()
    {
        this->cheese = true;
        return *this;
    }

    BurgerBuilder& addTomato()
    {
        this->tomato = true;
        return *this;
    }
    Burger* build()
    {
        return new Burger(*this);
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as:

```c++
Burger* burger = (new BurgerBuilder(14))
    				->addPepperoni()
                    ->addLettuce()
                    ->addTomato()
                    ->build();
```

**When to use?**

When there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor telescoping. The key difference from the factory pattern is that; factory pattern is to be used when the creation is a one step process while builder pattern is to be used when the creation is a multi step process.

🐑 Prototype
------------
Real world example
> Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning

In plain words
> Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

Wikipedia says
> The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.

**Programmatic Example**

```c++
class Root
{
public:
	virtual Root* clone() = 0;
	virtual void print() = 0;
};
class Tree :public Root
{
public:
	Tree(int num, float life) :Number(num), lifetime(life) {}
	Tree(const Tree& tree)
	{
		Number = tree.Number;
		lifetime = tree.lifetime;
	}
	virtual void print() override
	{
		std::cout <<"this is tree class!"<< std::endl;
	}
	virtual Root* clone()override
	{
		return new Tree(*this);
	}
private:
	int number;
	float lifetime;
};

class Leaf :public Tree
{
public:
	Leaf(int num, float life, std::string color)
		:Tree(num,life),color(color)
    {
    	
    }
	leaf(const Leaf& leaf)
	{
		color = leaf.color;
		number = leaf.number;
		lifetime = leaf.lifetime;
	}
	virtual Root* clone()
	{
		return new leaf(*this);
	}
	virtual void print()
	{
		std::cout << "This is leaf class." << std::endl;
	}
private:
	std::string color;
};

```

Then it can be cloned like below

```c++
Leaf  leaf(1,2.0,"red");
Root* root = leaf.clone();
root->print(); // Output: This is a leaf class.
```


**When to use?**

When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.

💍 Singleton
------------
Real world example
> There can only be one president of a country at a time. The same president has to be brought to action, whenever duty calls. President here is singleton.

In plain words
> Ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Singleton pattern is actually considered an anti-pattern and overuse of it should be avoided. It is not necessarily bad and could have some valid use-cases but should be used with caution because it introduces a global state in your application and change to it in one place could affect in the other areas and it could become pretty difficult to debug. The other bad thing about them is it makes your code tightly coupled plus mocking the singleton could be difficult.

**Programmatic Example**

To create a singleton, make the constructor private, disable cloning, disable extension and create a static variable to house the instance

```c++
class President
{
private:
    President()
    {
        
    }
public:
    static President& getInstance()
    {
        static President president; // thread safety in C++11 
        return president;
    }
    President(const President& president) = delete;
    void operator=(const President& president) = delete;
};
```


Then in order to use
```c++
President president1 = President::getInstance();
President president2 = President::getInstance();

std::cout << &president1==&president2 << std::endl // true
```

Structural Design Patterns
==========================
In plain words
> Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

🔌 Adapter
-------
Real world example
> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.
> Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet.
> Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another

In plain words
> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

**Programmatic Example**

Consider a game where there is a hunter and he hunts lions.

First we have an interface `Lion` that all types of lions have to implement

```C++
class Lion
{
public:
    virtual void roar() = 0;
};

class AfricanLion: public Lion
{
public:
	virtual void roar()
    {
    
    }
};

class AsianLion: public Lion
{
public:
	virtual void roar()
    {
    
    }
}
```

And hunter expects any implementation of `Lion` interface to hunt.

```c++
class Hunter
{
public:
    void hunt(Lion* lion)
    {
        lion->roar();
    }
};
```

Now let's say we have to add a `WildDog` in our game so that hunter can hunt that also. But we can't do that directly because dog has a different interface. To make it compatible for our hunter, we will have to create an adapter that is compatible

```c++
// This needs to be added to the game
class WildDog
{
public:
   void bark();
};

// Adapter around wild dog to make it compatible with our game
class WildDogAdapter: public Lion
{
private:
	WildDog* dog;
public:
	WildDogAdapter(WildDog* dog)
    	dog(dog)
    {
    
    }
    
    void roar()
    {
    	dog->bark();
    }
};

```

And now the `WildDog` can be used in our game using `WildDogAdapter`.

```
WildDog* wildDog = new WildDog();
WildDogAdapter* wildDogAdapter = new WildDogAdapter(wildDog);

Hunter* hunter = new Hunter();
hunter->hunt(wildDogAdapter);
```

🚡 Bridge
------
Real world example
> Consider you have a website with different pages and you are supposed to allow the user to change the theme. What would you do? Create multiple copies of each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate theme and load them based on the user's preferences? Bridge pattern allows you to do the second i.e.

![With and without the bridge pattern](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11269635/23065293/33b7aea0-f515-11e6-983f-98823c9845ee.png)

In Plain Words
> Bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance. Implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy.

Wikipedia says
> The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently"

**Programmatic Example**

Translating our WebPage example from above. Here we have the `WebPage` hierarchy

```c++
class WebPage
{
public:
    WebPage(Theme* theme);
    virtual std::string getContent() = 0;
};

class Theme;

class About: public WebPage
{
private:
	Theme* theme;
public:
	About(Theme* theme)
    	:theme(theme)
    {
    
    }
    virtual std::string getContent()
    {
    	return  "About page in " + theme->getColor();
    }
}

class Careers: public WebPage
{
private:
	Theme* theme;
public:
	About(Theme* theme)
    	:theme(theme)
    {
    
    }
    virtual std::string getContent()
    {
    	return "Careers page in " + theme->getColor();
    }
}
```

And the separate theme hierarchy

```c++
class Theme
{
public:
    virtual std::string getColor() = 0;
};

class DarkTheme: public Theme
{
public:
	virtual std::string getColor()
    {
    	return "Dark Black";
    }
};

class LightTheme: public Theme
{
public:
	virtual std::string getColor()
    {
    	return "Off white";
    }
}

class AquaTheme: public Theme
{
public:
	virtual std::string getColor()
    {
    	return "Light blue";
    }
}
```

And both the hierarchies

```c++
DarkTheme* darkTheme = new DarkTheme();

WebPage* about = new About(darkTheme);
WebPage* careers = new Careers(darkTheme);

std::cout << bout->getContent() << std::endl; // "About page in Dark Black";
std::cout << careers->getContent() << std::endl; // "Careers page in Dark Black";
```

🌿 Composite
-----------------

Real world example
> Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has the same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.

In plain words
> Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

Ways to create a Composite Pattern.

>1. Identify the scalar/primitive classes and vector/container classes
>2. Create an "interface" (lowest common denominator) that can make all concrete classes "interchangeable"
>3. All concrete classes declare an "is a" relationship to the interface
>4. All "container" classes couple themselves to the interface (recursive composition, Composite "has a" set of children up the "is a" hierarchy)
>5. "Container" classes use polymorphism as they delegate to their children



**Programmatic Example**

```c++
// 2. Create an "interface" (lowest common denominator)
class Component
{
  public:
    virtual void traverse() = 0;
};

class Leaf: public Component
{
    // 1. Scalar class   3. "isa" relationship
    int value;
  public:
    Leaf(int val)
    {
        value = val;
    }
    void traverse()
    {
        cout << value << ' ';
    }
};

class Composite: public Component
{
    // 1. Vector class   3. "isa" relationship
    vector < Component * > children; // 4. "container" coupled to the interface
  public:
    // 4. "container" class coupled to the interface
    void add(Component *ele)
    {
        children.push_back(ele);
    }
    void traverse()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < children.size(); i++)
        // 5. Use polymorphism to delegate to children
          children[i]->traverse();
    }
};

int main()
{
  Composite containers[4];

  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      containers[i].add(new Leaf(i *3+j));

  for (i = 1; i < 4; i++)
    containers[0].add(&(containers[i]));

  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
  {
    containers[i].traverse();
    cout << endl;
  }
}
/*
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
3 4 5
6 7 8
9 10 11
*/
```

> Imagine you run a car service shop offering multiple services. Now how do you calculate the bill to be charged? You pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. Here each type of service is a decorator.

In plain words
> Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.

**Programmatic Example**

Lets take coffee for example. First of all we have a simple coffee implementing the coffee interface

```c++
class Coffee
{
public:
    virtual int getCost() = 0;
    virtual std::string getDescription();
};

class SimpleCoffee: public Coffee
{
public:
	virtual int getCost()
    {
    	return 10;
    }
    virtual std::string getDescription()
    {
    	return "Simple coffee";
    }
}
```

We want to make the code extensible to allow options to modify it if required. Lets make some add-ons (decorators)

```c++
class MilkCoffee: public Coffee
{
private:
	Coffee* coffee;
public:
	MilkCoffee(Coffee* coffee)
		:coffee(coffee)
	{}
	virtual int getCost()
    {
    	return this->coffee->getCost() + 2;
    }
    virtual std::string getDescription()
    {
    	return this->coffee->getDescription + ", milk";
    }
};

class WhipCoffee: public Coffee
{
private:
	Coffee* coffee;
public:
	WhipCoffee(Coffee* coffee)
		:coffee(coffee)
	{}
	virtual int getCost()
    {
    	return this->coffee->getCost() + 5;
    }
    virtual std::string getDescription()
    {
    	return this->coffee->getDescription + ", whip";
    }
};

class VanillaCoffee: public Coffee
{
private:
	Coffee* coffee;
public:
	VanillaCoffee(Coffee* coffee)
		:coffee(coffee)
	{}
	virtual int getCost()
    {
    	return this->coffee->getCost() + 3;
    }
    virtual std::string getDescription()
    {
    	return this->coffee->getDescription + ", vanilla";
    }
};
```

Lets make a coffee now

```c++
Coffee* someCoffee = new SimpleCoffee();
std::cout << someCoffee->getCost(); // 10
std::cout << someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee

someCoffee = new MilkCoffee(someCoffee);
std::cout << someCoffee->getCost(); //12
std::cout << someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk

someCoffee = new WhipCoffee(someCoffee);
std::cout << someCoffee->getCost(); //17
std::cout << someCoffee->getDescritpion(); // Simple Coffee, milk, whip

someCoffee = new VanillaCoffee(someCoffee);
std::cout << someCoffee->getCost(); //20
std::cout << someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk, whip, vanilla
```



📦 Facade
----------------

Real world example
> How do you turn on the computer? "Hit the power button" you say! That is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade.

In plain words
> Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Wikipedia says
> A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our computer example from above. Here we have the computer class

```c++
class Computer
{
public:
 	void getElectricShock()
    {
        std::cout << "Ouch!" << std::endl;
    }

    void makeSound()
    {
        std::cout << "Beep beep!" << std::endl;
    }

    void showLoadingScreen()
    {
        std::cout << "Loading" << std::endl;
    }

    void bam()
    {
        std::cout << "Ready to be used!" << std::endl;
    }

    void closeEverything()
    {
        std::cout << "Bup bup bup buzzzz!" << std::endl;
    }

    void sooth()
    {
        std::cout << "Zzzzz" << std::endl;
    }
    
    void pullCurrent()
    {
        std::cout << "Haaah!" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

Here we have the facade

```c++
class ComputerFacade
{
private:
    Computer computer;
public:
    ComputerFacade(Computer computer)
        :computer(computer)
    {}
    void turnOn()
    {
        computer.getElementricShock();
        computer.makeSound();
        computer.showLoadingScreen();
        computer.bam();
    }
    
    void turnOff()
    {
        computer.closeEverything();
        computer.pullCurrent();
        computer.sooth();
    }
};
```

Now to use the facade

```c++
Computer computer;
ComputerFacade computerFacade(computer);
computer.turnOn(); // Ouch! Beep beep! Loading.. Ready to be used!
computer.turnOff(); // Bup bup buzzz! Haah! Zzzzz
```

🍃 Flyweight
---------

Real world example
> Did you ever have fresh tea from some stall? They often make more than one cup that you demanded and save the rest for any other customer so to save the resources e.g. gas etc. Flyweight pattern is all about that i.e. sharing.

In plain words
> It is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.

Wikipedia says
> In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern. A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our tea example from above. First of all we have tea types and tea maker

```c++
// Anything that will be cached is flyweight.
// Types of tea here will be flyweights.
class KarakTea
{
};

// Acts as a factory and saves the tea
class TeaMaker
{
private:
    std::map<std::string,KarakTea*> availableTea;
public:
    void make(const std::string& preference)
    {
        if(availableTea.find(preference)==availableTea.end())
            availableTea[preference] = new KarakTea();
        return availableTea[preference];
    }
};
```

Then we have the `TeaShop` which takes orders and serves them

```c++
class TeaShop
{
private:
    std::map<int,KarakTea*> orders;
    TeaMaker* teaMaker;
public:
    TeaShop(TeaMaker* teaMaker)
        :teaMaker(teaMaker)
    {}
    
    void takeOrder(const std::string& teaType, int table)
    {
        orders[table] = teaMaker->make(teaType);
    }
    
    void serve()
    {
        std::foreach(orders.begin,orders.end(),[](std::pair<int,KarakTea*> value){
            std::cout << "Serving tea to table# " << value.first << std::endl;
        })
    }
};
```

And it can be used as below

```c++
TeaShop teaShop(new TeaMaker());

teaShop->takeOrder("less sugar",1);
teaShop->takeOrder("more milk",2);
teaShop->takeOrder("without sugar",5);

teaShop.serve();
// Serving tea to table# 1
// Serving tea to table# 2
// Serving tea to table# 5
```

🎱 Proxy
-------------------
Real world example
> Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multiple options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality. Let me better explain it using the code example below.

In plain words
> Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.

Wikipedia says
> A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our security door example from above. Firstly we have the door interface and an implementation of door

```c++
class Door
{
public:
    virtual void open() = 0;
    virtual void close() = 0;
};

class LabDoor: public Door
{
public:
	virtual void open()
    {
    	std::cout << "Opening lab door" << std::endl;
    }
    virtual void close()
    {
    	std::cout << "Closing the lab door" << std::endl;  
    }
}
```

Then we have a proxy to secure any doors that we want

```c++
class SecuredDoor
{
private:
    Door* door;
public:
    SecuredDoor(Door* door)
    	:door(door)
    {}
    void open(const std::string& password)
    {
        if(authenticate(password))
            door->open();
        else
            std::cout << "Big no! It ain't possible.";
    }
    
    bool authenticate(const std::string& password)
    {
        return password == "$ecr@t";
    }
    
    void close()
    {
        door->close();
    }
};
```

And here is how it can be used

```c++
SecuredDoor door(new LabDoor());
door.open("invalid"); // Big no! It ain't possible.

door.open("$ecr@t"); // Opening lab door
door.close(); // Closing lab door
```

Yet another example would be some sort of data-mapper implementation. For example, I recently made an ODM (Object Data Mapper) for MongoDB using this pattern where I wrote a proxy around mongo classes while utilizing the magic method `__call()`. All the method calls were proxied to the original mongo class and result retrieved was returned as it is but in case of `find` or `findOne` data was mapped to the required class objects and the object was returned instead of `Cursor`.

Behavioral Design Patterns
==========================

In plain words
> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior in software component?"

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

🔗 Chain of Responsibility
-----------------------

Real world example
> For example, you have three payment methods (`A`, `B` and `C`) setup in your account; each having a different amount in it. `A` has 100 USD, `B` has 300 USD and `C` having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as `A` then `B` then `C`. You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD. Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account `A` will be checked if it can make the purchase, if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. If not, request will move forward to account `B` checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler. Here `A`, `B` and `C` are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.

In plain words
> It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.

**Programmatic Example**

Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts

```c++
class Account
{
private:
    Account* successor;
    float balance;
public:
    Account(float balance)
        :balance(balance), successor(nullptr)
    {
        
    }
    void setNext(Account* successor)
    {
		this->successor = successor;
    }
    void pay(float amountToPay)
    {
        if(canPay(amountToPay))
        {
            std::cout << "Paid " << amountToPay << " using " << typeid(*this).name() << std::endl;
        }else if(successor)
        {
            std::cout << "Cannot pay using "<< typeid(*this).name() << ". Proceeding .." ;
            this->successor->pay(amountToPay);
        }else
        {
            throw new Exception("None of the accounts have enough balance");
        }
    }
    bool canPay(float amount)
    {
        return balance >= amount;
    }
};

class Bank: public Account
{
public:
	Bank(float balance)
		:Account{balance}
	{}
};

class Paypal: public Account
{
public:
	Paypal(float balance)
		:Account{balance}
	{}
};

class Bitcoin: public Account
{
public:
	Bitcoin(float balance)
		:Account{balance}
	{}
};
```

Now let's prepare the chain using the links defined above (i.e. Bank, Paypal, Bitcoin)

```c++
// Let's prepare a chain like below
//      $bank->$paypal->$bitcoin
//
// First priority bank
//      If bank can't pay then paypal
//      If paypal can't pay then bit coin
Account* bank = new Bank(100); // Bank with balance 100
Account* paypal = new Paypal(200); // Paypal with balance 200
Account* bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300); // Bitcoin with balance 300

bank->setNext(paypal);
paypal->setNext(bitcoin);

// Let's try to pay using the first priority i.e. bank
bank->pay(259);
// Output will be
// ==============
// Cannot pay using bank. Proceeding ..
// Cannot pay using paypal. Proceeding ..:
// Paid 259 using Bitcoin!
```

👮 Command
-------

Real world example
> A generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant. You (i.e. `Client`) ask the waiter (i.e. `Invoker`) to bring some food (i.e. `Command`) and waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. `Receiver`) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook.
> Another example would be you (i.e. `Client`) switching on (i.e. `Command`) the television (i.e. `Receiver`) using a remote control (`Invoker`).

In plain words
> Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

**Programmatic Example**

First of all we have the receiver that has the implementation of every action that could be performed

```c++
// Receiver
class Bulb {
  public:
	void turnOn() {
		std::cout << "Bulb has been lit" << std::endl;
	}

	void turnOff() {
		std::cout << "Darkness!" << std::endl;
	}
};
```

then we have an interface that each of the commands are going to implement and then we have a set of commands

```c++
class Command {
  public:
	virtual void execute() = 0;
	virtual void undo() = 0;
	virtual void redo() = 0;
};

// Command
class TurnOn: public Command {
private:
	Bulb* bulb = nullptr;

public:
	TurnOn(Bulb* bulb)
        :bulb(bulb)
    {
	}

	void execute() {
		this->bulb->turnOn();
	}

	void undo() {
		this->bulb->turnOff();
	}

	void redo() {
		this->execute();
	}
};
class TurnOff: public Command {
private:
	Bulb* bulb = nullptr;

public:
	TurnOn(Bulb* bulb)
        :bulb(bulb)
    {
	}

	void execute() {
		this->bulb->turnOff();
	}

	void undo() {
		this->bulb->turnOn();
	}

	void redo() {
		this->execute();
	}
};


```

Then we have an `Invoker` with whom the client will interact to process any commands

```c++
// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
  public:
	void submit(Command* command) {
		command->execute();
	}
};

```

Finally let's see how we can use it in our client

```c++
auto bulb = new Bulb();
auto turnOn = new TurnOn(bulb);
auto turnOff = new TurnOff(bulb);
auto remote = new RemoteControl();
remote->submit(turnOn); // Bulb has been lit!
remote->submit(turnOff); // Darkness!
```

Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system. Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the `undo` on all the executed commands.

➿ Iterator
--------

Real world example
> An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.  

In plain words
> It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our radio stations example from above. First of all we have `RadioStation`

```c++
class RadioStation {
private:
	float frequency = 0.0;

public:
	RadioStation(float frequency)
        :frequency(frequency)
    {
	}

	float getFrequency() {
		return frequency;
	}
};
```

Then we have our iterator

```c++
class StationList
{
private:
    std::vector<RadioStation*> stations;
    int counter = 0;
public:
    void addStation(RadioStation* station)
    {
        stations.push_back(station);
    }
    void remoreStation(RadioStation* toRemove)
    {
        float toRemoveFrequency = toRemove->getFrequency();
        auto newEnd = std::remove_if(stations.begin(),stations.end(),[&toReomoveFrequency](RadioStation* station)
		{
        	return std::abs(station->getFrequency() - toRemoveFrequency) <= std::numeric_limits<float>::epsilon();                                 
		});
        stations.erase(newEnd,stations.end());
    }
    
    int count()
    {
        return stations.size();
    }
    
    RadioStation* current()
    {
        return stations[counter];
    }
    
    int key()
    {
        return counter;
    }
    
    void next()
    {
        ++counter;
    }
    
    void rewind()
    {
        counter = 0;
    }
    
    bool valid()
    {
        return counter < count();
    }
};
```

And then it can be used as

```c++
auto stationList = new StationList();
stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(89));
stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(101));
stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(102));
stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(103.2));
for (auto i = stationList->count(); i > 0; --i) {
	std::cout << stationList->current()->getFrequency() << std::endl;
	stationList->next();
}
// =====
// 89
// 101
// 102
// 103.2
// =====
stationList->remove(new RadioStation(89));
stationList->rewind();
for (auto i = stationList->count(); i > 0; --i) {
	std::cout << stationList->current()->getFrequency() << std::endl;
	stationList->next();
}
// =====
// 101
// 102
// 103.2
// =====
```

👽 Mediator
========

Real world example
> A general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone, there is a network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent. In this case network provider is mediator.

In plain words
> Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

**Programmatic Example**

Here is the simplest example of a chat room (i.e. mediator) with users (i.e. colleagues) sending messages to each other.

First of all, we have the mediator i.e. the chat room

```c++
class ChatRoomMediator {
  public:
	virtual void showMessage(User* user, std::string message) = 0;
};

class ChatRoom: public ChatRoomMediator {
  public:
	virtual void showMessage(User* user, std::string message)
    {
		auto t = time(nullptr);
		auto charTime = ctime(&t);
		auto sender = user->getName();
		std::cout << charTime << "[" << sender << "]: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};
```

Then we have our users i.e. colleagues

```c++
class User {
private:
	std::string name;
	ChatRoomMediator* chatMediator;
public:
	User(std::string name, ChatRoomMediator* chatMediator) 
        :name(name),chatMediator(chatMediator)
    {
	}

	std::string getName() {
		return name;
	}

	void send(std::string message) {
		chatMediator->showMessage(this, message);
	}
};
```

And the usage

```c++
auto mediator = new ChatRoom();
auto john = new User("John Doe", mediator);
auto jane = new User("Jane Doe", mediator);
john->send("Hi there!");
jane->send("Hey!");
// Output will be
// Feb 14, 10:58 [John]: Hi there!
// Feb 14, 10:58 [Jane]: Hey!
```



💾 Memento
-------

Real world example
> Take the example of calculator (i.e. originator), where whenever you perform some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons (i.e. caretaker).

In plain words
> Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.

Wikipedia says
> The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

Usually useful when you need to provide some sort of undo functionality.

**Programmatic Example**

Lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to time and that you can restore if you want.

First of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor state

```c++
class EditorMemento {
private:
	std::string content;
 public:
	EditorMemento(std::string content) 
        :content(content)
    {
	}

	std::string getContent() {
		return content;
	}
};
```

Then we have our editor i.e. originator that is going to use memento object

```c++
class Editor {
private:
	std::string content;
public:
	void type(std::string words) 
    {
        content += " " + words;
	}

	std::string getContent() {
		return content;
	}

	EditorMemento* save() {
		return new EditorMemento(content);
	}

	void restore(EditorMemento* memento) {
        content = memento->getContent();
	}
};
```

And then it can be used as

```c++
auto editor = new Editor();

// Type some stuff
editor->type("This is the first sentence.");
editor->type("This is second.");

// Save the state to restore to : This is the first sentence. This is second.
auto saved = editor->save();

// Type some more
editor->type("And this is third.");

// Output: Content before Saving
std::cout << editor->getContent() << std::endl; // This is the first sentence. This is second. And this is third.

// Restoring to last saved state
editor->restore(saved);
std::cout << editor->getContent() << std::endl; // This is the first sentence. This is second.
```

😎 Observer
--------
Real world example
> A good example would be the job seekers where they subscribe to some job posting site and they are notified whenever there is a matching job opportunity.   

In plain words
> Defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

Wikipedia says
> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have job seekers that need to be notified for a job posting

```c++
class JobPost {
private:
	std::string title = "";
public:
	JobPost(std::string title) 
        :title(title)
    {    
	}

	std::string getTitle() {
		return title;
	}
};

class Observer
{
public:
    virtual void onJobPosted(JobPost* job) = 0;
}；

class JobSeeker: public Observer
{
private:
	std::string name = "";
public:
	JobSeeker(std::string name) 
		:name(name)
	{
	}

	virtual void onJobPosted(JobPost* job) {
		std::cout << "Hi " << this->name << "! New job posted: "
		          << job->getTitle() << std::endl;
	}
};
```

Then we have our job postings to which the job seekers will subscribe

```c++
class Observable
{
public:
    virtual void notify(JobPost* jobPosting) = 0;
    virtual void attach(JobSeeker* observer) = 0;
};

class EmploymentAgency
{
private:
    std::vector<Observer*> observers;
public:
    virtual void notify(JobPost* jobPosting)
    {
        for(auto observer:observers)
        {
            observer->onJobPosting(jobPosting);
        }
    }
    
    virtual void attach(Observer* observer)
    {
        observers.push_back(observer);
    }
    
    void addJob(JobPost* jobPosting)
    {
        notify(jobPosting);
    }
};

```

Then it can be used as

```c++
// Create subscribers
auto johnDoe = new JobSeeker('John Doe');
auto janeDoe = new JobSeeker('Jane Doe');

// Create publisher and attach subscribers
auto jobPostings = new EmploymentAgency();
jobPostings->attach($johnDoe);
jjobPostings->attach($janeDoe);

// Add a new job and see if subscribers get notified
jobPostings->addJob(new JobPost('Software Engineer'));

// Output
// Hi John Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
// Hi Jane Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
```

🏃 Visitor
-------
Real world example
> Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.

In plain words
> Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using visitor pattern

```c++
// Visitee
class Anmial
{
public:
    virtual void accept(AnimalOperation* operation) = 0;
};

// Visitor
class AnimalOperation {
  public:
	virtual void visitMonkey(Monkey* monkey) = 0;
	virtual void visitLion(Lion* lion) = 0;
	virtual void visitDolphin(Dolphin* dolphin) = 0;
};


```

Then we have our implementations for the animals

```c++
class Monkey: public Animal {
  public:
	void shout() {
		std::cout << "Ooh oo aa aa!" << std::endl;
	}

	void accept(AnimalOperation* operation) {
		operation->visitMonkey(this);
	}
};

class Lion: public Animal {
  public:
	void roar() {
		std::cout << "Roaaar!" << std::endl;
	}

	void accept(AnimalOperation* operation) {
		operation->visitLion(this);
	}
};

class Dolphin: public Animal {
  public:
	void speak() {
		std::cout << "Tuut tuttu tuutt!" << std::endl;
	}

	void accept(AnimalOperation* operation) {
		operation->visitDolphin(this);
	}
};
```

Let's implement our visitor

```c++
class Speak: public AnmialOperation
{
public:
	void visitMonkey(Monkey* monkey)
    {
    	monkey->shout();
    }
    
    void visitLion(Lion* lion)
    {
    	lion->roar();
    }
    
    void visitDolphin(Dolphin* dolphin)
    {
    	dolphin->speak();
    }
};
```

And then it can be used as

```c++
auto monkey = new Monkey();
auto lion = new Lion();
auto dolphin = new Dolphin();
auto speak = new Speak();
auto jump = new Jump();
monkey->accept(speak);	// Ooh oo aa aa!  
lion->accept(speak);	// Roaaar!
dolphin->accept(speak); // Tuut tutt tuutt!
```

We could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.

```c++
class Jump: public AnimalOperation {
  public:
	void visitMonkey(Monkey* monkey) {
		std::cout << "Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!" << std::endl;
	}

	void visitLion(Lion* lion) {
		std::cout << "Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!" << std::endl;
	}

	void visitDolphin(Dolphin* dolphin) {
		std::cout << "Walked on water a little and disappeared" << std::endl;
	}
};
```

And for the usage

```c++
auto jump = new Jump();

monkey->accept(speak);   // Ooh oo aa aa!
monkey->accept(jump);    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!

lion->accept(speak);     // Roaaar!
lion->accept(jump);      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!

dolphin->accept(speak);  // Tuut tutt tuutt!
dolphin->accept(jump);   // Walked on water a little and disappeared
```

💡 Strategy
--------

Real world example
> Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets, bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.

In plain words
> Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation.

Wikipedia says
> In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have our strategy interface and different strategy implementations

```c++
class SortStrategy {
  public:
	virtual void sort(std::vector<int>& data) = 0;
};

class BubbleSortStrategy: public SortStrategy {
  public:
	void sort(std::vector<int>& data) {
		std::cout << "Sorting using bubble sort" << std::endl;
	}
};

class QuickSortStrategy: public SortStrategy {
  public:
	void sort(std::vector<int>& data) {
		std::cout << "Sorting using quick sort" << std::endl;
	}
};
```

And then we have our client that is going to use any strategy

```c++
class Sorter {
private:
	SortStrategy* sorter = nullptr;
public:
	Sorter(SortStrategy* sorter)
        :sorter(soter)
        {}

	void sort(std::vector<int>& data) {
		return sorter->sort(data);
	}
};
```

And it can be used as

```c++
std::vector<int> data1 = {1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8};

auto sorter1 = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy());
sorter1->sort(data1); // Output : Sorting using bubble sort

std::vector<int> data2 = {1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8};

auto sorter2 = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy());
sorter2->sort(data2); // Output : Sorting using quick sort
```

💢 State
-----
Real world example
> Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will be in blue etc.  

In plain words
> It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.

Wikipedia says
> The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass.
> The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of text editor, it lets you change the state of text that is typed i.e. if you have selected bold, it starts writing in bold, if italic then in italics etc.

First of all we have our state interface and some state implementations

```c++
class WritingState {
  public:
	virtual void write(std::string words) = 0;
};

class UpperCase: public WritingState {
  public:
	void write(std::string words) {
		std::transform(words.begin(), words.end(), words.begin(), ::toupper);
		std::cout << words << std::endl;
	}
};

class LowerCase: public WritingState {
  public:
	void write(std::string words) {
		std::transform(words.begin(), words.end(), words.begin(), ::tolower);
		std::cout << words << std::endl;
	}
};

class Default: public WritingState {
  public:
	void write(std::string words) {
		std::cout << words << std::endl;
	}
};
```

Then we have our editor

```c++
class TextEditor {
private:
	WritingState* state = nullptr;
public:
	TextEditor(WritingState* state) 
        :state(state)
    {
	}

	void setState(WritingState* state) {
		state = state;
	}

	void type(std::string words) {
		state->write(words);
	}
};
```

And then it can be used as

```c++
auto editor = new TextEditor(new Default());

editor->type("First line");

editor->setState(new UpperCase());
editor->type("Second line");

editor->type("Third line");
editor->setState(new LowerCase());

editor->type("Fourth line");
editor->type("Fifth line");

// Output:
// First line
// SECOND LINE
// THIRD LINE
// fourth line
// fifth line
```

📒 Template Method
---------------

Real world example
> Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like
> - Prepare the base of house
> - Build the walls
> - Add roof
> - Add other floors

> The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.

In plain words
> Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

**Programmatic Example**

Imagine we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on the test server.

First of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm

```c++
class Builder {
  public:
	// template method
	void build() {
		this->test();
		this->lint();
		this->assemble();
		this->deploy();
	}

	virtual void test() = 0;
	virtual void lint() = 0;
	virtual void assemble() = 0;
	virtual void deploy() = 0;
};
```

Then we can have our implementations

```c++
class AndroidBuilder: public Builder {
  public:
	void test() {
		std::cout << "Running Android tests" << std::endl;
	}

	void lint() {
		std::cout << "Linting the Android code" << std::endl;
	}

	void assemble() {
		std::cout << "Assembling the Android build" << std::endl;
	}

	void deploy() {
		std::cout << "Deploying Android build to server" << std::endl;
	}
};

class IosBuilder: public Builder {
  public:
	void test() {
		std::cout << "Running iOS tests" << std::endl;
	}

	void lint() {
		std::cout << "Linting the iOS code" << std::endl;
	}

	void assemble() {
		std::cout << "Assembling the iOS build" << std::endl;
	}

	void deploy() {
		std::cout << "Deploying iOS build to server" << std::endl;
	}
};

```

And then it can be used as

```c++
auto androidBuilder = new AndroidBuilder();
androidBuilder->build();

// Output:
// Running android tests
// Linting the android code
// Assembling the android build
// Deploying android build to server

auto iosBuilder = new IosBuilder();
iosBuilder->build();

// Output:
// Running ios tests
// Linting the ios code
// Assembling the ios build
// Deploying ios build to server
```
